# RN MenuBar for macOS sample Project

This is a sample project of how you can create a menu bar app on macOS using react-native and the newly released react-native-macos, if you want to create one yourself you can follow the steps from my [Blog](https://ospfranco.github.io/post/2020/05/23/how-to-make-a-react-native-menu-bar-app-for-mac-os/)

## Caveats

Not all is without pains, react-native-macos is so new, none of the native libraries will work, react-native-vector-icons work fine if you follow the mac os steps, but the pod installation is messed up.

You also don't have react-navigation, at least the latest version, you will have to make due with the old v2 branch that uses pure javascript.
